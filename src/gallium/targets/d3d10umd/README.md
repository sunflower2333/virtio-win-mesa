# D3D10umd Readme

When compiled with `gallium-driver=llvmpipe` or `gallium-driver=softpipe` the resulting libgallium_d3d10.dll implements D3D10's software rendering interface, like WARP.

It can be used directly from WLK 1.6 and WHCK 2.0 D3D10+ tests, via the -Src
and -SWDLL options. For example:

    wgf11blend.exe -Debug -DoNotCatchExceptions -DXGI:1.1 -FeatureLevel:10.0 -Src:SW -SWDLL:libgallium_d3d10.dll -LogClean -LogVerbose

However, as of WHCK version 2.1 this mechanism no longer works reliably.
Either you use WHCK 2.0 binaries, or you must use the alternative method
described below (of copying libgallium_d3d10.dll into the executable directory and rename
it such that it matches the D3D10 UMD of the test machine).

Examples can be easily modified to load it too:

    D3D10CreateDeviceAndSwapChain(NULL,
                                  D3D10_DRIVER_TYPE_SOFTWARE,
                                  LoadLibraryA("libgallium_d3d10"), /* Software */
                                  Flags,
                                  D3D10_SDK_VERSION,
                                  &SwapChainDesc,
                                  &g_pSwapChain,
                                  &g_pDevice);

    D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain(NULL, /* pAdapter */
                                  D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_SOFTWARE,
                                  LoadLibraryA("libgallium_d3d10"), /* Software */
                                  Flags,
                                  FeatureLevels,
                                  sizeof FeatureLevels / sizeof FeatureLevels[0],
                                  D3D11_SDK_VERSION,
                                  &SwapChainDesc,
                                  &g_pSwapChain,
                                  &g_pDevice,
                                  NULL, /* pFeatureLevel */
                                  &g_pDeviceContext); /* ppImmediateContext */

Alternatively, it can be renamed into the system's D3D10 UMD driver (e.g.,
vm3dum_10.dll for VMware vGPU, nvwgf2um.dll for NVIDIA GPU), and placed into
the application directory, or system's directory, and used instead.

For the DLL to be picked from the application directory you'll need to do the
following once:

    reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v "SafeDllSearchMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

## Zink offscreen probe

A Windows build with `-Dgallium-drivers=zink` can select Zink through
`GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink`. This is an offscreen D3D GPU-development slice: Zink
loads the installed Vulkan ICD and can exercise Gallium rendering, but it does
not export `WINSYS_HANDLE_TYPE_D3DKMT_ALLOC`. The target therefore rejects that
handle request and must not be installed as the display UMD or used for DXGI
Present until a versioned WDDM allocation bridge is implemented.

The `zink_d3d11_offscreen.exe` probe loads `viogpud3d-zink.dll` from its
application directory, clears a 64x64 RGBA8 render target to red, copies it to
a staging texture, and validates every mapped pixel plus checksum `2088960`.
It creates no window or swap chain and does not call DXGI Present.

## Yttrium configuration

Yttrium options read through `yttrium_gdi_debug_get_option()` first consult the
process environment and then `C:\ProgramData\Yttrium\yttrium.ini`.  An
environment value therefore overrides the matching INI value for that process.
The INI file is loaded once in each process; changing it does not reconfigure an
already running application.

`D3D10UMD_YTTRIUM_DRAW_ARENA_BAR` is disabled by default.  When enabled, the
transient vertex and index arenas first prefer host-visible, coherent,
device-local memory and retain the compatible-memory fallback.  The option may
be set either in the process environment or in `yttrium.ini`; use a process
environment override for isolated comparisons.

## Building with MSVC

Install Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0 and Windows DDK 10.0.26100.0 with MSVC and use it, other version of Windows SDK/DDK
may also work but not verified.

## Building with mingw

Install Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0 and Windows DDK 10.0.26100.0, other version of Windows SDK/DDK
may also work but not verified.

Copy the following list of files from Windows SDK/DDK into mingw's `include` folder or `include\winddk` folder in mesa source tree:
    ```txt
    d3d10umddi.h
    d3dkmddi.h
    d3dkmdt.h
    d3dkmthk.h
    d3dukmdt.h
    d3dumddi.h
    dxgiddi.h
    dxmini.h
    wmidata.h
    ```
